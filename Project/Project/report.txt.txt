Inventory Forecasting & Recommendation System â€” Report

Problem Statement:
Hotel chain faces stockouts and overstocking, affecting guest satisfaction and increasing costs.

Approach:

Cleaned and aggregated historical consumption data.

Forecasted 7-day consumption using 30-day moving average.

Applied safety stock using 1.5x demand standard deviation.

Simulated 30 days of demand to validate par levels.

Insights:

High demand items with high variability require larger par levels.

Stockouts still occur for highly volatile items even with safety stock.

This system provides starting recommendations for inventory managers.

Assumptions:

Daily demand follows a normal distribution.

Safety stock factor set at 1.5.

No external seasonality or event impact considered.

Next Steps:

Incorporate seasonality, events, promotions into demand modeling.

Use advanced forecasting methods like ARIMA, Prophet or ML models.

Adjust safety stock dynamically based on service level goals.
